**1. Introduction**

*Background and Significance*
Genetics has been one of the most growing science fields, and yet we still know too little about diseases mechanisms or be able to provide proper treatments. Individual's genetics has been known to be a major player in differentiating response to different pharmacological compounds. The field of pharmacogenomics is rapidly growing, with the aim of providing personalized interventions for patients by uncovering the genetic basis of inter-individual variability in drug response. However, currently available pharmacogenomic services are limited in their ascertainment of genetic variation, with an emphasis on metabolism and known drug targets and mechanisms of action. This approach may result in blind spots relating to off-target effects as well as additional therapeutic mechanisms. A more comprehensive understanding of drug response could provide recommendations that maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects.

In particular, there is a critical need for personalized drug recommendations for patients with psychiatric disorders. These patients often have complex medication regimens and can experience a wide range of responses to treatment, from total remission to life-threatening side effects. By integrating whole-genome genotype information, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), Polygenics Scores (PGS) of psychiatric traits, and transcriptional perturbation assays, it may be possible to develop models with reduced bias that can recommend drugs on an individual basis.

This research proposal aims to address the critical need for personalized drug recommendations for patients with psychiatric disorders by integrating disparate data sources to develop more comprehensive models of drug response. The proposed research builds on previous studies that have identified genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with psychiatric disorders, as well as studies that have investigated the effects of small molecules on gene expression. By integrating these data sources, we aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of drug response that takes into account the complex genetic and environmental factors that contribute to inter-individual variability.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve patient outcomes by providing personalized drug recommendations that maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects. By developing more comprehensive models of drug response that take into account the complex genetic and environmental factors that contribute to inter-individual variability, we hope to provide clinicians with a powerful tool for optimizing patient care. Ultimately, the proposed research could lead to improved treatment outcomes and a better quality of life for patients with psychiatric disorders.
